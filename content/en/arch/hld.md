## System Overview

- Purpose and scope of service provision
- Concept of operation automation
- Overview of major operational functions
- Roles and responsibilities of the operations team
- Definition of Service Level Objectives (SLO)

## System Architecture

- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) design
- Rationale for microservices/monolith configuration choice
- Dependencies between components
- Service discovery design
- Adoption of event-driven architecture

## Technology Stack

- Containerization technology (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Orchestration tools
- Monitoring/Observability tools
- Log management/analysis tools
- Security tools
- Automation toolchain

## Deployment Architecture

- Multi-cloud/Hybrid design
- Region/Availability Zone configuration
- Environment separation strategy (Production/Staging/Development)
- GitOps-based deployment
- Blue/Green deployment design

## Data Architecture

- Distributed database design
- Data replication strategy
- Cache strategy
- Data persistence design
- Data lifecycle management
- Backup/Restore design

## Integration Points

- API gateway design

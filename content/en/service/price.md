- **System Scale**: Base fee determined by the number of servers, network devices, and applications managed
- **Support Level**: Response time and support framework based on SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- **Standard Operational Workload**: Time required for routine monthly operations (e.g., inspections, backup management)
- **Bug Fixing Workload**: Monthly effort for addressing application defects
- **User Inquiries**: Fee based on the number of helpdesk tickets received
- **Additional Services**: Optional add-ons such as security management and consulting services
